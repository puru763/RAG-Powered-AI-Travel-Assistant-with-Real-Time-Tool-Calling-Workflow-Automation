# Contextual-Multi-Model-Integration-Platform
Built a modular Spring Boot AI integration layer using Spring AI to connect enterprise microservices with multiple LLMs (OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama). Implemented a RAG pipeline with Qdrant/PGVector for context-aware responses and added agent-style tool calling so LLMs can trigger Java backend functions for multi-step workflows.
